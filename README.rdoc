== README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version - Tested on 2.3.0

* How to run the test suite - Need to bundle install followed by db:migrate

* Deployment instructions - None, tested locally, can deploy to Heroku

This is a test based on Finance tracker sample app.

Please feel free to use a different markup language if you do not plan to run
<tt>rake doc:app</tt>.
